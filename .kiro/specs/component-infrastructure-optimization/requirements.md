# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the requirements for completing the component implementation, standardizing data flow, fixing type definitions, and implementing real integration testing for the GROW YouR NEED SaaS School platform. The goal is to replace placeholder components with fully functional implementations that leverage the existing robust API infrastructure, ensuring consistent data flow patterns and comprehensive testing coverage.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Complete Component Implementation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all placeholder components to be replaced with fully functional implementations that utilize the existing API infrastructure, so that the frontend provides complete functionality to end users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the journal page THEN the JournalEntry and JournalEntryForm components SHALL display real data and provide full CRUD functionality
2. WHEN a user interacts with the creative assistant THEN the CreativeAssistant component SHALL connect to the real AI service and provide brainstorming, feedback, and content generation features
3. WHEN a user accesses mood tracking THEN the MoodFocusCheckIn component SHALL save data to the database and display analytics
4. WHEN any component loads THEN it SHALL use the existing custom hooks pattern for API integration
5. WHEN components encounter errors THEN they SHALL display appropriate error states and retry mechanisms
6. WHEN components load data THEN they SHALL show proper loading states with skeleton UI
7. WHEN users interact with forms THEN they SHALL have real-time validation and optimistic updates

### Requirement 2: Standardize Data Flow Architecture

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a consistent data flow pattern across all components, so that the codebase is maintainable and follows established patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any component needs API data THEN it SHALL use custom hooks (useFetch, useJournal, useCreativeAssistant, etc.)
2. WHEN components need global state THEN they SHALL use the Zustand application store
3. WHEN API calls are made THEN they SHALL go through the standardized api-client utility
4. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be handled consistently through the error boundary system
5. WHEN optimistic updates are needed THEN they SHALL use the optimistic mutation hooks
6. WHEN real-time updates are required THEN they SHALL use the WebSocket service integration
7. WHEN components need authentication THEN they SHALL use the authorization middleware pattern

### Requirement 3: Fix Type Definitions and Alignment

**User Story:** As a developer, I want TypeScript interfaces to accurately reflect API responses and database schemas, so that type safety is maintained throughout the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API responses are received THEN they SHALL match the defined TypeScript interfaces exactly
2. WHEN database operations occur THEN the data types SHALL align with PocketBase schema definitions
3. WHEN components receive props THEN the prop types SHALL be strictly typed and validated
4. WHEN hooks return data THEN the return types SHALL be properly defined and exported
5. WHEN forms are submitted THEN the form data types SHALL match API endpoint expectations
6. WHEN errors occur THEN error types SHALL be properly typed and handled
7. WHEN the TypeScript compiler runs THEN there SHALL be zero type errors in the codebase

### Requirement 4: Implement Real Integration Testing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want integration tests that call real API endpoints instead of mocks, so that I can verify the complete functionality of the application stack.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integration tests run THEN they SHALL call actual API routes instead of mocked functions
2. WHEN testing user workflows THEN tests SHALL interact with the real PocketBase database in test mode
3. WHEN testing authentication THEN tests SHALL use the real authorization middleware
4. WHEN testing AI features THEN tests SHALL use the real Ollama service or provide fallback responses
5. WHEN tests complete THEN they SHALL clean up test data automatically
6. WHEN tests fail THEN they SHALL provide detailed error information for debugging
7. WHEN the test suite runs THEN it SHALL complete in under 30 seconds for optimal developer experience

### Requirement 5: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to load quickly and respond instantly to interactions, so that I have a smooth and efficient experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pages load THEN initial render SHALL occur within 200ms
2. WHEN API calls are made THEN they SHALL include proper caching headers and strategies
3. WHEN components re-render THEN they SHALL use React.memo and useMemo for optimization
4. WHEN large datasets are displayed THEN they SHALL implement virtual scrolling or pagination
5. WHEN images are loaded THEN they SHALL use Next.js Image optimization
6. WHEN JavaScript bundles are built THEN they SHALL be code-split and tree-shaken
7. WHEN the application runs THEN it SHALL achieve a Lighthouse performance score of 90+

### Requirement 6: Error Handling and Resilience

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to gracefully handle errors and provide helpful feedback, so that I can continue using the application even when issues occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API calls fail THEN the application SHALL display user-friendly error messages
2. WHEN network connectivity is lost THEN the application SHALL queue operations for retry
3. WHEN components crash THEN error boundaries SHALL prevent the entire application from failing
4. WHEN data conflicts occur THEN the conflict resolution system SHALL provide merge options
5. WHEN services are unavailable THEN fallback functionality SHALL be provided where possible
6. WHEN errors are logged THEN they SHALL include sufficient context for debugging
7. WHEN users encounter errors THEN they SHALL have clear recovery actions available

### Requirement 7: Testing Infrastructure Improvements

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a robust testing infrastructure that supports both unit and integration testing, so that I can maintain code quality and prevent regressions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Jest runs THEN it SHALL support both Node.js and jsdom environments correctly
2. WHEN TypeScript tests are executed THEN they SHALL compile without syntax errors
3. WHEN test utilities are used THEN they SHALL provide consistent mock data and helpers
4. WHEN integration tests run THEN they SHALL use a separate test database instance
5. WHEN tests need authentication THEN they SHALL use test-specific auth tokens
6. WHEN API tests run THEN they SHALL test actual HTTP endpoints with real request/response cycles
7. WHEN the test suite completes THEN it SHALL provide comprehensive coverage reports

### Requirement 8: Developer Experience Enhancements

**User Story:** As a developer, I want excellent tooling and development experience, so that I can be productive and maintain high code quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is written THEN TypeScript SHALL provide accurate IntelliSense and error detection
2. WHEN components are developed THEN hot reload SHALL work correctly for all file types
3. WHEN debugging is needed THEN source maps SHALL be accurate and helpful
4. WHEN code is committed THEN linting and formatting SHALL be enforced automatically
5. WHEN APIs are tested THEN there SHALL be clear documentation and examples
6. WHEN errors occur in development THEN they SHALL provide actionable error messages
7. WHEN the development server starts THEN it SHALL be ready within 5 seconds
