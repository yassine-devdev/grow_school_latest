### Core Monitoring & Communication

-   **Home**: A personalized dashboard for parents, providing a high-level overview of their child's day, including upcoming assignments, recent grades, and school-wide announcements.
-   **Billing & Payments**: A secure portal to view invoices, make tuition payments, and manage payment methods.
-   **School Events**: A calendar and list view of all upcoming school events, from parent-teacher conferences to sports games and concerts.
-   **Daily Digest**: A customizable daily or weekly email summary of a child's activities, grades, and upcoming deadlines.

### Advanced Child Progress & Wellness

-   **Learning Pulse Tracker**: An advanced, real-time dashboard dedicated to a child's academic and wellness status. It includes detailed grade breakdowns, attendance trends, missing assignment alerts, and recent teacher feedback, all in one place.
-   **AI Behavior & Wellness Alerts**: An AI-powered system that discreetly monitors a child's digital interactions and platform usage patterns to identify potential signs of distress or negative behavior, sending a confidential alert to the parent if a potential issue is detected.
-   **Childâ€™s Emotional Health Insights**: A tool that provides parents with anonymized, aggregated insights into their child's emotional well-being based on journal entries and communication sentiment (with privacy safeguards).
-   **Child Safety Tracking & Permissions**: A dashboard for managing permissions, such as approved pick-up lists, and tracking a child's location on campus during school hours via RFID/GPS integration.

### AI-Powered Support & Engagement

-   **Real-Time Communication Hub**: A dedicated chat interface for direct communication with teachers. It features two powerful AI tools:
    -   **One-Click Translation**: Instantly translates messages from teachers into the parent's preferred language using Gemini.
    -   **AI Message Drafting**: Helps parents compose polite and effective messages. A parent can type a simple intent (e.g., "ask about missing homework"), and AI will draft a well-structured message.
-   **Homework Support & AI Coach**: An AI tutor, powered by Gemini, that parents can use alongside their child. It helps guide the child through difficult homework problems without giving direct answers, empowering the parent to support their child's learning.
