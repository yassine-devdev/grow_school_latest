title: "Version 7.0.0"
description: "RVE now works on mobile. Introducing mobile responsiveness, templates, clip speed control, and custom assets."
founderNotes: "This update focuses on closing out some of the most highly requested features from the roadmap. || The biggest change: you can now use the editor on mobile. Mobile responsiveness is built-in and can be toggled via settings. || Weâ€™ve also introduced templates and stickers, a major step toward customizable, reusable editing flows. Create your own templates and export them, or explore new animated stickers from the RVE library. || On top of that, you can now upload your own images, videos, and audio locally, control playback rate, and adjust individual clip speeds. || There are also a number of bug fixes and unit tests under the hood. As always, let us know what you think!"
