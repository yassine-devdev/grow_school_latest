# React Video Editor Pro

## New Features

### Video Filter Presets

We've added a new feature to apply stylistic filter presets to videos, including popular looks like Retro, Vintage, and Wes Anderson style.

#### How It Works

The filter presets use standard CSS filter functions that are fully compatible with Remotion rendering. Each preset is defined as a string of CSS filter properties like:

```js
// Example of the Wes Anderson filter
"contrast(110%) brightness(105%) saturate(160%) hue-rotate(350deg)";
```

These filters are stored in the `ClipOverlay` object's `styles.filter` property and applied directly to the video element during both preview and final rendering.

#### Remotion Compatibility

Since we're using standard CSS filters rather than WebGL shaders or complex post-processing, the filters will render consistently in both the editor preview and final video export. The `VideoLayerContent` component applies these filters via inline styles to the `OffthreadVideo` component from Remotion.

#### Adding New Presets

To add new filter presets, edit the `VIDEO_FILTER_PRESETS` array in:
`components/editor/version-7.0.0/constants/video-filter-presets.ts`

Each preset should have:

- `id`: Unique identifier
- `name`: Display name
- `description`: Brief description of the look
- `filter`: CSS filter string

Example of adding a new preset:

```typescript
{
  id: "summer",
  name: "Summer",
  description: "Bright, colorful look with warm tones",
  filter: "brightness(110%) saturate(130%) contrast(105%) hue-rotate(355deg)"
}
```

#### User Interface

The filters are presented as visual thumbnails showing how each filter affects the current video. Users can see a live preview before applying the filter, making it easier to choose the right look for their video.
